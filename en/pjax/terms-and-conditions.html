                        damage or loss caused by an error, inaccuracy, misunderstanding or misspelling with regards to the translations.</li>

                            <li>Throughout the duration of the Transaction and for as long as the Transaction is open, you are required to maintain a sufficient Account Equity to cover any Margin Requirement. If your Account Equity is less than the Margin Requirement in
                                relation to the open Transaction you wish to create, you have entered into a Margin Call and you are required to fund the shortfall immediately. You may not be able to place an Order to open a Transaction until the shortfall has been funded and there
                                is sufficient Account Equity to cover the Total Margin.</li>

                            <li>The Margin Requirement is a percentage of the value of the Open Positions and will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the value of the Open Positions throughout the duration of the relevant contracts (the “Contract Value”).</li>
                            <li>The Margin Requirements can increase / decrease based on the aggregated size of your Open Position determined by the volume (number of lots), contract size (value per point in the original currency of the contract), market price and margin
                                rate.</li>
                            <li>We may modify Margin Requirements for any Open Positions or new Transactions entered into, at our sole discretion. Formulas for Margin Requirements published on the website are indicative only and may be changed by the Company at its

                            <li>If the Margin Level for your Real Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, this will be classified as an Event of Default. In such circumstances, Open Positions are automatically closed in the following order: (i) the server
                                analyses clients’ Orders that are not under execution at the moment; (ii) the server deletes Orders with the largest Margin; (iii) if your Margin Level is still under the Stop Out Level, the next order is deleted (orders without margin requirements
                                are not deleted); (iv) if your Margin Level is still under the Stop Out Level, the server closes a position with the largest loss; (v) Open Positions are closed until your Margin Level becomes higher than the Stop Out Level.</li>
                            <li>The default Stop Out Level applicable to your Account is published on our website. However, the default Stop Out Level is subject to alteration at our absolute discretion. Any changes to the Stop Out Level will take effect immediately. We

                        an obvious or palpable error (a Manifest Error). In deciding whether an error is a Manifest Error, we may take into account any relevant information including, the state of the underlying market at the time of the error and any error within, or lack
                        of clarity of, any information source or pronouncement. You have a duty to report to us any such problems, errors or suspected system inadequacies that you may experience and may not abuse of or arbitrage such system problems or errors for profit. We
                        will endeavour to resolve any such difficulties in the shortest time possible. Any amendments to the contractual terms of Manifestly Erroneous contracts shall be reasonable and fair. Monies exchanged between you and us in connection with the
                        Manifestly Erroneous contracts shall be returned to the recipient according to the amendments made to the contractual terms. You further acknowledge and agree that we will not be held liable or responsible, whether directly or indirectly, for any
                        loss, expenses or damage caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with a Manifest Error.</li>
